> Please provide a description of your workshop.

- **Who is this for**: developers, devops engineers
- **What you'll learn**: the risk of script Injections in GitHub Actions workflows, and how to migirate that risk
- **What you'll build**: workflows that are not vulnerable to script injection attacks

## Learning Objectives

In this workshop, you will:

  - learn about script injection vulnerabilities in GitHub actions workflows
  - learn how to mitigate script injection vulnerabilities in GitHub actions workflows
  - learn how Github Advanced Security can help you build secure GitHub actions workfows

## :mega: Prerequisites
Before joining the workshop, there are a few items that you will need to install or bring with you.
- an org with actions enabled
- an org with GHAS enabled

## :bomb: Exercise 1: Script injection in the run command

The [Check issue title workflow](.github/workflows/check-issue-title.yml) simply checks if the title of the workflow begins with octocat. If so, the workflow succeeds. If not, the workflow fails.  

This workflow is vulnerable to script injection. Let's find out why.  
[Exercise 1](./exercises/exercise-1.md)  

## :bomb: Exercise 2 - Script injection in github-script action

The [Check issue comment](.github/workflows/check-issue-comment.yml) workflow simply checks if the issue comment begins with `octocat`. If so, the workflow succeeds. If not, the workflow fails.  

This workflow is vulnerable to script injection. Let's find out why.

## :lock: Exercise 3 - Mitigate script injection in the run command

Let's see how we can mitigate script injection vulnerability in the run command.  
[Exercise 3](./exercises/exercise-3.md)  

## :lock: Exercise 4 - Migrate script injection in github-script action

Let's see how we can mitigate script injection vulnerability in github-script action.  
[Exercise 4](./exercises/exercise-4.md)  

## :mag: Exercise 5 - Mitigate using CodeQL Action Workflow

Let's create an actions workflow to scan our workflow files using CodeQL.  
[Exercise 5](./exercises/exercise-5.md)  

## :european_castle: Exercise 6 - Enhance the detection of vulnerabilities using third party queries

Now let's look at another way we can use CodeQL to secure our GitHub actions workflows.
